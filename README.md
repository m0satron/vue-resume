# vue-resume

*This is a work in progress vue version of my resume.\s\s
*The intention is to show that I can write code.\s\s
*It is designed with reusability and accessibility in mind\s\s
*I will add a backend to this in the future, so basically all data will be received in app.vue and passed as props to the child components\s\s

*Since the project is in its start, there are some empty areas, if you want to look at my code standard you can look inside: src/components/Menu, src/components/Card and src/App and src/style\s\s
